# fractal_display
Personal projet to play around with an interactive fractal display. This project is pretty basic as of now but it works :)

Controls:
* arrows  -> move around(translation)
* numpad1 -> Doubles current precision, needed for bigger zooms
* numpad4 -> Halves current precesion
* +       -> zoom in
* -       -> zoom out

Technologies currently used: 
* SFML
* Boost/Multiprecision

Stuff I'll try to use/achieve:
* CUDA
* OpenCL

Currently looks like that: ![alt tag](https://github.com/JulienCote/fractal_display/blob/master/sample%20pictures/fractal5.PNG)
